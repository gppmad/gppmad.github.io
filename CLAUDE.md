# Claude Usage Guidelines

## Commit Messages

**IMPORTANT:** Do not mention Claude or add Claude attribution in commit messages.

When creating commits, exclude the following:
- "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)"
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- Any other Claude-related attribution or mentions

Keep commit messages clean, professional, and focused on the actual changes made.
