Hi Friends!

I am Giuseppe, I am Italian and I live in Germany.
I am a software engineer and I love building things.

Curiosity has always been my best quality.
I don't have a specific list of things I'm interested in, but if I really need to write one down, I would definitely mention:

- Engineering
- Philosophy
- Politics
- Economics
- Sociology
- Entrepreneurship
- Reading
- Writing
- Tennis
- Swimming
- Carrying weights

The list is definitely not ordered by importance.
I would also list Food and Cooking as a separate item.

Since I am Italian (from Sicily) the quality of the dishes (and of the coffee) plays an important role in my life.
