Today, I’m happy to open source one of my latest projects: https://github.com/gppmad/passkey-extension.

It's a simple passkey chrome extension that allows you to store and use passkeys.

Passkeys and other passwordless mechanisms are undoubtedly the future of authentication, and it’s becoming increasingly important to be transparent about where these credentials are stored and how they are synced across devices.

That’s why I decided to create a small Chrome extension that fully implements the Web Authentication Level 2 specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/), with a focus on passkey information exchange.

All objects are stored locally and are never transmitted elsewhere.

Contributions and feedback are very welcome.
